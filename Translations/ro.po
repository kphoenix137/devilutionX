"Take heed and bear witness to the truths that lie herein, for they are the "
"last legacy of the Horadrim. Nearly three hundred years ago, it came to be "
"known that the Three Prime Evils of the Burning Hells had mysteriously come "
"to our world. The Three Brothers ravaged the lands of the east for decades, "
"while humanity was left trembling in their wake. Our Order - the Horadrim - "
"was founded by a group of secretive magi to hunt down and capture the Three "
"Evils once and for all.\n"
" \n"
"The original Horadrim captured two of the Three within powerful artifacts "
"known as Soulstones and buried them deep beneath the desolate eastern sands. "
"The third Evil escaped capture and fled to the west with many of the "
"Horadrim in pursuit. The Third Evil - known as Diablo, the Lord of Terror - "
"was eventually captured, his essence set in a Soulstone and buried within "
"this Labyrinth.\n"
" \n"
"Be warned that the soulstone must be kept from discovery by those not of the "
"faith. If Diablo were to be released, he would seek a body that is easily "
"controlled as he would be very weak - perhaps that of an old man or a child."
