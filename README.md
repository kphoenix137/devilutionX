# wkdmod is a fork of DevilutionX
## wkdmod aims to implement more quality of life changes that are deemed out of scope for DevX.  This modified version of DevilutionX focuses on a more modern and casual approach to ARPG gameplay and mechanics.

wkdmod is compatible* with standard DevilutionX characters. Simply copy your character data and stash data into the **devxmods/wkdmod folder in %appdata%/roaming/**

***WARNING** Unique Items are not forward compatible.  They will morph when brought into wkdmod, it is suggested to just toss them on to the ground or sell them to a vendor.  However, white and magic (blue) items are forward compatible into wkdmod.

### **DevX Release 1.5.x** with additional **NEW** features:

**[GLOBAL]**
- When Diablo is killed the game does not end and he drops loot (drops 6 items).
- Buffed loot drop chances 300% in Hell, 200% in Nightmare, Normal is unchanged.
- When killing Diablo, Nakrul, Hork Demon or Defiler loot drop tiers are determined by difficulty.  Best drops from these bosses will be found on Hell difficulty.
- Diablo and Nakrul have been buffed and are much more difficult to defeat.
- Nightmare and Hell monster HP/AC/ToHit has been increased
- previous Triple Immunes now have RESISTANCE TO MAGIC and can be hit by magic spells
- Nightmare and Hell difficulties have been buffed significantly
- MLVL's have been increased in Nightmare and Hell to allow for slightly better affix pools in the higher difficulties.
- Wirt's shop price cap has been raised from 200,000 to 300,000. 
- Items are no longer destroyed at 0 durability, they become disabled and you must repair.
- Players do not drop items on death, unless you enable **INVADER** mode, more details below.  -1% TOTAL CHARACTER Experience upon death.
- Shared XP in multiplayer games.
- Character's now have a natural random chance to dodge incoming missiles.  This scales with character level.
- Character's now gain a passive spell dodge affect based on resistances to that spell element.
- Fixed Bug that currently persists in DevilutionX where not all Unique items could actually be found.
- Black Deaths no longer permanently damage your character, HOWEVER, they have been given the same LIFESTEAL mechanic as the Skeleton King.
- Warrior, Barbarian, and Bard have all received a melee and ranged ToHit buff and are no longer desperate for Dexterity/ToHit gear.
- Barbarian no longer takes damage from the Rage skill, it will drain mana instead if the Barbarian has any
- Buffed Barbarian's passive bonuses to include 2H Axes, 2H Maces, Staffs, 2H Swords
- Buffed Bard's passive bonuses with dual wielding any combination of 1H weapons
- Bard is now buffed when wearing Unique, Medium, and Light Armor.  However receives a debuff when wearing non-Unique Heavy Armor (same as Monk).
- Golem has been buffed significantly and can no longer take Friendly Fire damage.
- Rogue gains +100 on Normal, +500 on Nightmare, or +1000 on Hell experience points when disarming a trap
- The Thorns affix has been reworked into Holy Fire.  Holy Fire damage can be boosted by elemental damage Oils and will do full additive damage from any equipped   Holy Fire source to any   
  Monster that melee hits the player.
- The Damage% line of affixes have been buffed, ending with Merciless which now can get up to 250% damage (151 - 250).
- The +Damage line of affixes have been buffed, ending with Slaughter, which now can get up to +50 damage (17 - 50).
- Nerfed Apocalypse in Diablo so it acts like its Hellfire counterpart
- Swapped some scrolls out for the four oils I added in Hellfire, nobody will miss them

**UNIQUE ITEM OVERHAUL**
- Quest uniques have been brought in line with how easy they are to obtain, but mostly have also received buffs (a small handful nerfed) and can be farmed for      better/preferred rolls on stats
- Some items will seem to have more punishing curses on them, but this is only because of how powerful they are and the curses are really there to make it a 
  dangerous item for under leveled characters
- I have chosen to have uniques roll stats in line with the affix table, and I call this out in this document.  If there is an affix with a corresponding stat on 
  a unique, it is called out
- Some Uniques are simply just going to be better than others, no way to avoid that.  But hopefully everything is at least useful if found in a playthrough even 
  if not the most optimal piece in the long run... also trying to maintain theme of the items as well 

**SPELL AND ELEMENTAL WEAPON DAMAGE BALANCING**
- Holy Bolt is now Magic Missile
- Magic Missile, Blood Star and Bone Spirit have had damage buffs in line with their balance in the game and Blood Star/Bone Spirit should be considered equivalent damage to Fireball
    - Bone Spirit being a significantly stronger spell for high magic users and it is more then triple the mana cost of Blood Star) (edited)
- Firebolt (+Guardian), Charged Bolt, Inferno and Lightning have had slight damage buffs to scale with character level, and these spells pierce enemy immunes and damage is resisted instead of ignored.
- Lightning and Fire WEAPON damage pierce enemy immunes and damage is resisted instead of ignored.  This includes the special Hellfire weapons that cast spells based on Weapon element damage.

**OILS**
- All available Oils now drop in Classic and Hellfire multiplayer mode as well as singleplayer mode and added the following NEW Oils with NEW changes to 
  Accuracy, Mastery, Hardening, Imperviousness, Sharpening, Death, Permanence (note Blacksmith Oil has been removed):
- Oil of Sharpening:  +1 minimum dmg, with 15/20/30/40 being the ceiling for minimum dmg for bows/1h/2h/Axe respectively / Can never exceed Maximum Damage
- Oil of Death:  +2 maximum dmg, with 30/35/60/80 being the ceiling for maximum dmg for bows/1h/2h/Axe respectively 
- Oil of Accuracy: Can now increase passive or active ToHit bonus on a weapon to 60
- Oil of Mastery: Can now increase passive or active ToHit bonus on a weapon to 120
- Oil of Hardening: Can now increase item AC to a maximum of 60
- Oil of Imperviousness: Can now increase item AC to a maximum of 90
- Oil of Permanence: 10% Chance to make an item Indestructible, will increase item durability slightly on fail only if item durability is 200 or greater.  If increasing an item above 255 with Permeance it will automatically become Indestructible.
- Oil of Wick & Spark: +2 minimum fire/lightning dmg, with a ceiling of 200 minimum fire/lightning damage / Can never exceed maximum fire/lightning damage
- Oil of Sun & Storm: +4 maximum fire/lightning dmg, with a ceiling of 200 maximum fire/lightning damage

**Splash damage now does damage to two extra tiles** (so its more like a U instead of a T, the shape of the splash), and can be accessed with the following classes/weapons (and thanks to DevX is applied in both Diablo and Hellfire gamemodes):
- **Monk:** Staff, 2H Sword
- **Warrior:** 2H Sword, 1H Sword + Shield, 1H Mace + Shield (must have Shield equipped for splash to work with 1H)
- **Barbarian:** 2H Sword, 2H Axe, Staff, 2H Mace
- **Bard:** 2x 1H Sword, 2x 1H Mace, or 1H Sword + 1H Mace
- **Sorcerer:** Staff
- **WEAPONS EXPERT** (unlocked at Lvl 40) All classes gain access to splash damage on all melee weapons and barehanded.

**[HELLFIRE ONLY]**
- Auric Amulet can now be held in your inventory to receive the double gold pile capacity bonus and you no longer have to equip it.
- Monk is now buffed when wearing Unique, Medium, and Light Armor.  However receives a debuff when wearing non-Unique Heavy Armor (same as Bard).
- Buffed Monk's abilities with barehanded and 2H Sword
- Monk now has Infravision as a class skill
- Search Books and Search Scrolls no longer drop
- Hork Demon amulet drop is now a higher item level depending on difficulty (Normal: ilvl 15, Nightmare: ilvl 20, Hell: ilvl 30) and he drops more or less items depending on difficulty.
- Hellfire spell blocking has been completely removed.
- Hork Spawn now drop items like normal monsters.
- Fixed Hellfire Arrow behavior to be like Diablo
- Gnat Sting now always properly fires 3 arrows in a strafe pattern instead of bugging out and only firing one arrow if the player tries to attack too quickly.
- Runes have been disabled

**[INVADER]**
- INVADER is a stand alone game mode within wkdmod.  It's just your standard wkdmod Diablo or Hellfire... but with a twist...
- If you toggle Friendly Fire ON within wkdmod, you will no longer have access to your normal characters and stash.  Instead, you will have access to your INVADER characters and stash.  
- INVADER characters and stash ARE NOT MEANT TO BE BACKED UP.  This is not enforceable, but if you play this mode and back up your files you are a wussy... especially because I already give you the chance to play with FF off and not lose your shit!
- INVADER characters are meant to be played in public games, and are encouraged to kill each other and take each others items.

**RECOMMENDED GAME SETTINGS FOR WKDMOD**
- <a href="https://github.com/wkdgmr/wkdmod/blob/5d408772fc32f20652193196221e57e9a8e1692b/diablo.ini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOWNLOAD PRECONFIGURED SETTINGS FILE</a> place this file into the **devxmods/wkdmod folder in %appdata%/roaming/** (or whatever location the game data is located depending on device you are playing on)
- Multiplayer (Select Loopback to play solo offline)
- SP QUESTS IN MP ON/OFF* optional, I like them on while playing in Normal.  I then turn off for NM and Hell.  There are pros/cons to on/off for instance having    them on let's you farm quests like Warlord of Blood, but having them off let's you farm Lvls 15/16 Lazerus/Diablo faster 
- Crippling Shrines OFF
- (Hellfire) Theo ON* Theo quest needs to be on in order to get the Auric Amulet.  Once you have it you can turn this off.
- (Hellfire) Cow Quest can be turned on if you want to score some backstage tickets to Aerosmith at the coliseum, and delve into the Hive in search of the Bovine 
  Plate...
- Friendly Fire OFF* Friendly Fire ON now enables INVADER game mode.  You will drop items upon death at the hands of monsters and players.
- **DEVIATE FROM THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AT YOUR PERIL**
- Please feel free to change any setting not mentioned here to your preference.

# What is DevilutionX

DevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki) for what features are available and how best to take advantage of them.

For a full list of changes see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternately you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/spawn.mpq) [[2]](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will need to also copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
